#fuelCell0Foam -- clean version

This is uploaded to have a repository as backup.

This is going to be cleaned.

The source code was developed from an open-source repository OpenFuelCell and the standard solver "reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam" in OpenFOAM. It can be used to consider coupling transport phenomena in electrochemical devices, e.g. fuel cells, electrolyzers, etc. More applications will be available in the future.

At this point, the source code needs to be cleaned up and necessary comments should be added. This code will hopefully be made open-source for fuel cell/electrolyzer communities. I hope this can be done as soon as possible.

There will be additional people who are interested in helping cleaning the code, I will keeping adding them in the list:
