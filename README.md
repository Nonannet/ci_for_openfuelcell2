# fuelCell0Foam

A CFD solver for fuel cells and electrolyzers.

---

The source code was developed from an open-source repository [openFuelCell](http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/) and the standard solver "reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam" in OpenFOAM. It can be used to consider coupling transport phenomena in electrochemical devices, e.g. fuel cells, electrolyzers, etc. More applications will be available in the future.

The source code is being cleaned up and necessary comments will be added. This code will hopefully be made open-source for fuel cell/electrolyzer communities.

## How to use

---

The code is compiled based on the OpenFOAM libraries, either [Foundation version](https://openfoam.org/) or [ESI version](https://www.openfoam.com/). The default branch is compatable with the foundation version, while the branch 'ofESI' works with the OpenFOAM-ESI environment.

- [Foundation version](https://openfoam.org/)

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone XXX fuelCell0Foam

cd fuelCell0Foam

./Allwmake
```

- [ESI version](https://www.openfoam.com/)

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone XXX fuelCell0Foam

cd fuelCell0Foam

# Switch to the 'ofESI' branch
git switch ofESI

./Allwmake
```

You can also clear the libraries and executable files with

```bash
./Allwclean
```

## Computational domains

---

Take the cross-section of a fuel cell as an example. The computational domain gives,

</div>

In a PEM fuel cell, there are several domains/regions: air, fuel, electrolyte, and interconnect. This can be found from the repository [openFuelCell](http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/). However, additional domains/regions, e.g. phiEA, phiEC, and phiI are also necessary to account for electron/proton and dissolved water transfer.

To consider the coupling transfer problems in a PEM fuel cell, a master region, also called as parent mesh, and several sub-regions, also called as child meshes, are used. In the master region, only energy equation is solved. In the sub-regions, corresponding partial differential equations will be solved. During the simulation, material properties, e.g. density, thermal conductivity, etc., are mapped from sub-regions to the master region, while the temperature field is mapped from the master region to the sub-regions.

The sub-regions can be classified as three different types, namely fluid, solid, and electron/proton regions. See the [code](fuelCellSystems/fuelCellSystem/regions).

- Fluid region:

  This region represents the space where fluid flows by. In a fuel cell or electrolyzer, it consists with gas channels and/or porous regions. In this region, the following processes are addressed:

  - Fluid flow (single/two phase)
  - Species transfer
  - Electrochemical reaction
  - Heat and mass transfer

  For example, in a fuel cell, the following parts apply to this type,

  - Air flow paths + porous electrodes
  - Fuel flow paths + porous electrodes
  - Cooling channels

- Solid region:

  This represents the solid components. In this solver, no eqautions will be solved here. However, in future applications, stress analysis during assembly and thermal effects may be implemented.

  In a fuel cell, the following components apply to this type,

  - Electrolyte/membrane
  - Interconnect/Bipolar-plate
  - Endplate

- Electron/proton region:

  This region accounts for the electric-conductive components. This region is designed to consider electron/proton transfer specifically. However, it is found that the proton transfer region is the same as the region where dissolved water transfer takes place. Therefore, a switcher is set in the code to turn on/off the dissolved water transfer model. The following eqautions will be solved,

  - Potential equations (Possion equations)
  - Dissolved water transfer equations (diffusion and electro-osmotic-drag)

  In a fuel cell, the following regions belong to this type:

  - Bipolar-plate, GDL, MPL, CL -> electron transfer regions
  - Catalyst coated membrane, CCM, -> proton transfer and dissolved water transfer region

- Master region:

  The heat source/sinks in sub-regions will be mapped to this region. And the obtained temperature is mapped back to sub-regions. The heat source/sink include:

  - Joule heat from the electron/proton regions.
  - Phase change in the fluid regions.
  - Electrochemical reactions in the fluid regions.
